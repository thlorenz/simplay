usage: simplay <artist>

Retrieves similar artists from http://last.fm and prints out youtube, last.fm and rdio playlist or artist links.
Artists are ordered in reverse, so that the best match is at the bottom of your terminal.

NOTE: 
  You need to create a last.fm account and obtain an API key: http://www.last.fm/api/account/create
  Then you need to set the LASTFM_API environment variable to your key.

  As an alternative you can always provide the key when you run simplay like so:

  LASTFM_API=abcd123 simplay metallica
